h1. mkp_gravatar

This tag returns an imagetag or an url with the gravatar for the email address of the current comment or any given email address.

h2. Acknowledgements

Previously, there have been two other Gravatar plugins for Textpattern but both are currently in orphan status. I started this one from scratch using "PHP Image Requests":https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/php/ from the Gravatar Developer Resources. But I also looked at glx_gravatar for implementation ideas (and the format of this help document).

h2. mkp_gravatar

Just use &lt;txp:mkp_gravatar /&gt; where ever you need a gravatar to be displayed. If you put this tag into a comment form the gravatar will be constructed using the email address given by the current comment. If you put this tag anywhere else (where mkp_gravatar has no access to a comment email address) you can supply an email address by the attribute email to create the accompanying gravatar.</p>

h3. Attributes

h4. email (default: empty/email address of current commentator)</h4>

Used inside a comment form the plugin will choose the current commenters email address. If you use this tag outside of the comment forms this attribute is needed to give glx_gravatar the email address to be encoded. Every email can be gravatar encoded.

h4. size (default: 80)

1 to 512 &#8211; defines the size of the resulting gravatar, if ommited it will be 80px. All gravatars are squared.

h4. default (default: gravatar-logo)

define which image(s) to display when no email address is available. If this attribute is missing gravatar.com&#8217;s white G on blue ground will be displayed. If you supply the url of an image here it will be used. Further it is possible to use gravatar.com&#8217;s integraton icons based on the submitted email address:

* 404: do not load any image if none is associated with the email hash, instead return an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> 404 (File Not Found) response
* mm: (mystery-man) a simple, cartoon-style silhouetted outline of a person (does not vary by email hash)
* identicon: a geometric pattern based on an email hash
* monsterid: a generated &#8216;monster&#8217; with different colors, faces, etc
* wavatar: generated faces with differing features and backgrounds
* retro: awesome generated, 8-bit arcade-style pixelated faces

defines the rating for the gravatar.

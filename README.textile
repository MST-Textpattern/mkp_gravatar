h1. mkp_gravatar

This tag returns an image tag or an URL with the Gravatar for the email address of the current comment or any given email address.

From the Gravatar Site: An "avatar" is an image that represents you onlineâ€”a little picture that appears next to your name when you interact with websites. A Gravatar is a Globally Recognized Avatar. You upload it and create your profile just once, and then when you participate in any Gravatar-enabled site, your Gravatar image will automatically follow you there.

h2. Acknowledgements

Previously, there have been two other Gravatar plugins for Textpattern but both are currently in orphan status. I started this one from scratch using "PHP Image Requests":https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/images/php/ from the Gravatar Developer Resources as a Guide. I also looked at the code of glx_gravatar for implementation ideas (and the format of this help document).

h2. mkp_gravatar

Just use &lt;txp:mkp_gravatar /&gt; where ever you need a Gravatar to be displayed. If you put this tag into a comment form the Gravatar will be constructed using the email address given by the current comment. If you put this tag anywhere else (where mkp_gravatar has no access to a comment email address) you can supply an email address by the attribute email to create the accompanying Gravatar.</p>

h3. Attributes

h4. email (default: empty/email address of current commentator)

Used inside a comment form the plugin will choose the current commenter's email address. If you use this tag outside of the comment forms this attribute is needed to give mkp_gravatar the email address to be encoded. Any email can be Gravatar encoded.

h4. size (default: 80)

Defines the size of the resulting Gravatar (range: 1 to 512). All Gravatars are squared.

h4. rating (default: g)

Defines the rating for the Gravatar.

* g: suitable for display on all websites with any audience type.
* pg: may contain rude gestures, provocatively dressed individuals, the lesser swear words, or mild violence.
* r: may contain such things as harsh profanity, intense violence, nudity, or hard drug use.
* x: may contain hardcore sexual imagery or extremely disturbing violence.

h4. default (default: gravatar-logo)

Define which image(s) to display when an email address has no Gravatar. If this attribute is missing gravatar.com&#8217;s white G on blue ground will be displayed. If you supply the <span class="caps">URL</span>of an image here it will be used. Further it is possible to use gravatar.com&#8217;s integration icons based on the submitted email address:

* 404: do not load any image if none is associated with the email hash, instead return an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> 404 (File Not Found) response
* mm: (mystery-man) a simple, cartoon-style silhouetted outline of a person (does not vary by email hash)
* identicon: a geometric pattern based on an email hash
* monsterid: a generated &#8216;monster&#8217; with different colors, faces, etc
* wavatar: generated faces with differing features and backgrounds
* retro: awesome generated, 8-bit arcade-style pixelated faces
